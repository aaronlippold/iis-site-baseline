  configurations and may flag a worker process as unhealthy and shut it down. An
  application poolâ€™s pinging monitor must be enabled to confirm worker processes
  are functional. A lack of response from the worker process might mean the
  worker process does not have a thread to respond to the ping request, or it is
  hanging for some other reason. The ping interval and ping response time may
  need adjustment to gain access to timely information about application pool
  health without triggering false, unhealthy conditions; for example, instability
  caused by an application."
